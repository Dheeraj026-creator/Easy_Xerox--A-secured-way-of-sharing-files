- Project: Easy Xerox – A simple and secure way to share files.
- Problem Solved: Eliminates the need for WhatsApp for both shop owners and customers, avoiding clutter, manual sharing, and privacy issues.
- How It Works: Admin generates a unique link (e.g., /example) with a password. Customers enter a code (e.g., abc) → redirected to /example/abc to upload files instantly.
- Admin Control: Admin can view, download, or delete files per user code; the password grants access to all active codes.
- Technology: Built with Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, MongoDB Atlas, and Multer.
- Features: Real-time synchronization, QR-based uploads, automatic file expiration.
- Deployment & Storage: Fully deployed on Render; data securely stored on MongoDB Atlas.
- Benefits: Saves time, improves efficiency, ensures secure, organized, and modern file sharing for both customers and shop owners.
