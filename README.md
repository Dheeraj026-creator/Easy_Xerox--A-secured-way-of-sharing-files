# Using the App

### Home Page
- The app opens to a home page containing the QR generation page and Login/Signup page  
- **Login is required** to access the QR generation page  

### QR Generation
- After login, users can generate a QR code  
- The page provides:  
  - The generated link for the user (http://localhost:5000/generatedlink)  
  - An associated password  
  - A downloadable QR image  
  - An option to regenerate the link if needed  
- This link acts as the home page for the customer  
- Scanning the QR code also leads to this page  

### Customer File Upload
- On the generated link page, customers can enter a desired code (e.g., `abc` or `dhee`)  
- They are redirected to:  
  http://localhost:5000/generatedlink/abc
  in this url user can upload their file 


- Users can upload files (images, PDFs, PPTs, etc.)  

### Admin Access
- If the entered code matches the associated password, it redirects to the admin page:  
https://xeroxshop-1.onrender.com/example/<assopassword>
here the codes enteres by the users are listed in the form of buttons by clicking that the admin can download and print files 

yaml
Copy code
