## Project Overview
Easy Xerox eliminates the need for WhatsApp for both shop owners and customers, avoiding clutter, manual sharing, and privacy issues. It allows secure, real-time file sharing through unique links and QR codes.

---

## How It Works
- Admin generates a unique link (e.g., `/example`) with a password  
- Customers enter a code (e.g., `abc`) → redirected to `/example/abc` to upload files instantly  
- Admin can access all submitted codes using the associated password  

---

## Admin Control
- View, download, or delete files per user code  
- The password grants access to all active codes for centralized management  

---

## Technology Stack
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- Socket.io  
- MongoDB Atlas  
- Multer  

---

## Features
- Real-time synchronization  
- QR-based uploads  
- Automatic file expiration (2 minutes)  

---

## Deployment & Storage
- Fully deployed on Render  
- Data securely stored on MongoDB Atlas  

---

## Benefits
- Saves time and improves efficiency  
- Ensures secure, organized, and modern file sharing  
- Simplifies file management for both customers and shop owners

# Using the App

### Home Page
- The app opens to a home page containing the QR generation page and Login/Signup page  
- **Login is required** to access the QR generation page  

### QR Generation
- After login, users can generate a QR code  
- The page provides:  
  - The generated link for the user (https://xeroxshop-1.onrender.com/generatedlink)  
  - An associated password  
  - A downloadable QR image  
  - An option to regenerate the link if needed  
- This link acts as the home page for the customer  
- Scanning the QR code also leads to this page  

### Customer File Upload
- On the generated link page, customers can enter a desired code (e.g., `abc` or `dhee`)  
- They are redirected to:  
https://xeroxshop-1.onrender.com/example/<entered-code>

markdown
Copy code
- Users can upload files (images, PDFs, PPTs, etc.)  

### Admin Access
- If the entered code matches the associated password, it redirects to the admin page:  
https://xeroxshop-1.onrender.com/example/<assopassword>

yaml
Copy code
- The admin can see all codes as clickable buttons, leading to the respective user-uploaded files  
- Admins can download or print files  
- Files are automatically deleted after 2 minutes
